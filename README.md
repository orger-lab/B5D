# Orger lab B5D Implemenation

A reimplementation of B3D, but extending it to work with 5D datasets.

To use:

 - Clone the Weightloss branch.
 - Set the Windows Environment Variable HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH to point to where you want the .dll files in the x64/Release folder to live. Leaving them in place is fine.
 - The filter code is 306. You will need to supply this to python/matlab/etc only when writing B5D compressed files
 - See the original repo [here](https://git.embl.de/balazs/B3D) for more detailed instructions.
