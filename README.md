## Setup

To use:

 - Clone the Weightloss branch to your local computer.
 - Download and install [this version](https://support.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/releases/hdf5-1.10/hdf5-1.10.8/bin/windows/hdf5-1.10.8-Std-win10_64-vs16.zip) of the HDF5 Library. 
 - Run vcredist.exe from the vcredist folder in the B5D repo. 
 - Set the Windows Environment Variable HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH to point to where you want the .dll files in the x64/Release folder to live. Leaving them in place is fine.
 - The filter code is 306. You will need to supply this to python/matlab/etc only when writing B5D compressed files
 - See the original repo [here](https://git.embl.de/balazs/B3D) for more detailed instructions.
